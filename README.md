# Big Catch!

## Introduction:

"Big Catch!" is a tabletop miniature game about fishing for big fish. It's played with two dice and is designed to be simple and enjoyable for players of all ages. The game is played with 2 or more players and each player takes turns trying to catch fish.

## Equipment:

- 2 dice: one 6-sided die and one 20-sided die
- Score-pad and pencil for each player
- A set number of fish, for example 20 fish

## Gameplay:

1. The game starts with a set number of fish, for example 20 fish.
2. On your turn, roll the 6-sided die. If the roll is 1, 2, or 3, you have caught a fish and proceed to step 3. If the roll is 4, 5, or 6, your turn ends and play passes to the next player without catching a fish.
3. Roll the 20-sided die to determine the size of the fish you caught. The result of the roll represents the size of the fish in centimeters.
4. If you role a 20 on the 20-sided die, you have caught a "Big Catch!", shout "Big Catch!" and add 10 points to your score, as well as the points you would ordinarily gain from the fish.
5. You gain 5 points for the fish plus 1 point for every centimeter of the fish.
6. If this is the first fish you have caught this turn, you can now either:
   a) Keep the fish you caught and add its points to your score.
   b) Release the fish you caught and try again (return to step 2).
7. Record the points of the fish you caught on your score-pad.
8. If two or more players catch fish of the same size on the same turn, the player who caught the fish first scores the points.
9. Reduce the number of remaining fish by 1.
10. The next player takes their turn.

## End of the Game:

The game ends when all the fish have been caught. The player with the highest score at the end of the game is declared the winner.

I hope these rules provide a fun and engaging experience for you and your friends. Have fun playing "Big Catch!"!
